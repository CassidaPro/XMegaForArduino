ATXMega128A4U bootloader

This is a modification of the Arduino bootloader, which is derived from the
Adafruit bootloader 'as downloaded' that builds on POSIX-compatible systems 
and uses an AVRISPmkII to program the target.

For a serial port bootloader:

  make xmega; make flashboot

For a USB bootloader:

  make usb; make flashbootusb
